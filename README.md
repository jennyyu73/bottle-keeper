# Bottle Keeper
Messenger bot with quick replies and one-time notification 
made by Jun Kim and Jenny Yu

# Purpose
This Messenger bot simulates the experience of sending and finding messages in a bottle, hopefully as a way to bring us all closer together in these trying times. Note, we currently do not have the server and MongoDB cluster actively running due to prolonged inactivity, but you can find a short demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScYBarpqWrs. 

# Technology
- Nodejs
- Heroku server
- MongoDB data storage with GraphQL
- Sentiment analyzer
- Messenger API with Quick Replies and One-Time Notifications

# Features
- Anonymously send a message "in a bottle" as many times as you wish.
    - The bot will automatically filter out inappropriate or rude messages. 
- Have the bot search for bottled messages to be delivered to you. You will receive an anonymous message bottle at a later time and date, depending on the number of bottles sent by others.
